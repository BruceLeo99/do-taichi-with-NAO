## Why? 🤔
- People are feeling more stressed and less motivated nowadays than ever (Anna C. Phillips et al., 2015)
- A prospective solution for: "*I feel so lazy!😴*", "*I don't have time to exercise!😵‍💫*", "*I am so stressed and I don't know what to do! 😩*", "*It's Monday again? 🫠*", *etc.*
- Evidence exists showing that:
  - Taichi can significantly increase the quality of sleep, and mood and reduce the feeling of stress, depression, and anxiety for both youngsters and elderlies (M. Candice Ross et al., 1999) (Karen et al., 2010)
  - certain types of non-verbal communication, such as open-body gestures, can generate a sense of willingness and friendliness to the communicators (How to Read Body Language and Facial Expressions, 2022)
  - **Robots can help!** Human-Robot Interaction affects pain and stress reduction (Geva et al., 2022), and improves physical and mental strength likewise (E.A. Konjin, 2022).
