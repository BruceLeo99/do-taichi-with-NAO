# Welcome! 🤖

###### This is a mini robotic program that leads the users to perform a short Taichi exercise ☯️ with a charmful greeting at the end 
###### This program is:
- Executed on a physical mini robot, namely [NAO](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nao_(robot))
- Coded with [Choregraphe](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/support/nao-6/downloads-softwares): A platform to design NAO Robot movements and powered by *Python*
- Ready-to-use: Simply download and connect!
- Highly expandable: add whatever features and movements you prefer for future use!

## Why? 🤔
- People are feeling more stressed and less motivated nowadays than ever (Anna C. Phillips et al., 2015)
- A prospective solution for: "*I feel so lazy!😴*", "*I don't have time to exercise!😵‍💫*", "*I am so stressed and I don't know what to do! 😩*", "*It's Monday again? 🫠*", *etc.*
- Evidence exists showing that:
  - Taichi can significantly increase the quality of sleep, and mood and reduce the feeling of stress, depression, and anxiety for both youngsters and the elderly (M. Candice Ross et al., 1999) (Karen et al., 2010)
  - certain types of non-verbal communication, such as open-body gestures, can generate a sense of willingness and friendliness to the communicators (How to Read Body Language and Facial Expressions, 2022)
  - **Robots can help!** Human-Robot Interaction affects pain and stress reduction (Geva et al., 2022), and improves physical and mental strength likewise (E.A. Konjin, 2020).
 
## How to use? 🔨
1. Download the file and install  [Choregraphe](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/support/nao-6/downloads-softwares)
2. (If Missing vcomp120p.dll) Install *Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013* - this package is required to run Choregraphe
3. Open Choregraphe, go to *File->Import Project from CRG file* from the top menu bar and select the .CRG file from this repo
4. go to *Edit->Preferences->Virtual Robot* from the top menu bar, and select a NAO robot model
5. Click play to see its virtual performance
